#this file is helpful in URL rewriting(creating clean and user-friendly URLs)
#It also help restrict access to specific files
# Also useful in managing the cache 
# Helpful in setting permanent and temporary redirects
# Comments:
# - `Options -MultiViews` prevents Apache from guessing file extensions (e.g., serving `about.php` for `/about`)
# - `RewriteEngine On` enables mod_rewrite
# - Conditions:
#   - Don't rewrite if the file (`-f`) or directory (`-d`) actually exists
# - `RewriteRule` forwards everything to `index.php`, adding the path as `$_GET['url']`
